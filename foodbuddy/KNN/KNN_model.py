----
12/02/2024 :
1. Packaging is done
2. Now running with Google Cloud Storage platform
3. Pushed to GitHub for sharing with teammates
WIP 1: MLFlow push
WIP 2: Fine-tuning recommendations with nutrient deficiency/overreach thresholds (probably in predictions_to_output.py)


11/28/2024 :
1. Summarizing the KNN notebook to streamline the code
2. Will package it later into functions
